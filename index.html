  <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>One piece of software I have personally used and believe is designed well is Snapchat.
    Snapchat is a social media platform that focuses on communication, and what sets it apart
    from other platforms is its user-friendly interface and simple design. When you first open
    Snapchat, you're immediately greeted by the camera, allowing you to quickly capture photos
    or videos, known as "snaps." This feature is effective because it allows users to readily 
    capture and share moments with others as soon as the app is launched. Once a photo is taken,
    users can easily save it or send it to others. Snapchat also allows customization of these 
    snaps with text, stickers, filters, sounds, and more, making the experience interactive and
    personalized. One of Snapchat's key implementation is its default auto-delete feature, where
    messages disappear after being viewed. This design choice appeals to users who may not want
    messages to be saved, but also gives users the flexibility by allowing them to save specific 
    messages, images, or videos if they want. The platform is clearly designed with its target
    audience of teens and adults in mind. Snapchat also allows users to personalized avatars known
    as Bitmojis,which  adds fun and personal touch to the app. Features like Snap Map allow users 
    to see their friends locations, and stories allow users to share moments from their day, which
    enhances social interaction and engagement keeping users hooked and using the app longer.

  <p>Good software design is important because it impacts user experience and engagement. Good software
    design is intuitive and easy to use, which is important in making users want to continue to use it.
    Software with good design can easily be updated which makes it more adaptable to future changes,
    aswell as cutting costs as there is are less bugs and errors reducing the need to fix it often.
